Remaining work

1. Optional hardening

- Extend numeric range validation coverage to all remaining percent/rate fields not yet bounded.
- Audit any remaining TODO/FIXME comments.

Notes:
- Keep JSON-path-specific validation error quality.
- Preserve documented simplifications unless intentionally upgraded with tests.
