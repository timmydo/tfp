Blank-slate next steps (remaining work only)

1. Immediate next target

Implement a real bundled historical return dataset in `tfp/historical_data.py`.

- Replace the current synthetic/generated series with fixed annual returns for 1926-2024.
- Keep shape compatible with existing simulation code (`{year: (stocks, bonds)}`).
- Ensure coverage is exactly continuous from 1926 through 2024.
- Add tests that verify:
  - first/last year presence,
  - full-year continuity,
  - deterministic repeatability,
  - known-point spot checks for selected years.

2. Report phase (still largely open)

Implement the full Phase 6 HTML/report stack from `PLAN.md`.

- Add `charts.py`, `sankey.py`, and `templates.py` and wire them from `report.py`.
- Replace scaffold HTML with self-contained interactive report (inline CSS/JS, no external dependencies).
- Implement required charts:
  - net worth stacked area,
  - income vs expenses,
  - account balances,
  - tax burden stack,
  - allocation over time,
  - withdrawal sources,
  - success probability (MC/historical).
- Implement money-flow Sankey with year slider.
- Implement required tables:
  - annual summary,
  - money flow,
  - per-account detail.
- Add dashboard/tabs layout and insolvency highlighting.
- Include report metadata (mode, seed, timestamp, plan hash).

3. Verification/test expansion

Add missing tests called out by PLAN.md.

- Golden tests (`tests/test_golden.py`) for stable normalized annual outputs.
- Boundary interaction tests (SS start month, Medicare transition, RMD start year, mortgage payoff month).
- Integration tests for:
  - MC reproducibility with fixed seed,
  - insolvency path/report visibility,
  - generated HTML basic structure/parse checks.

4. Optional hardening after above

- Extend numeric range validation coverage to all remaining percent/rate fields not yet bounded.
- Audit any remaining TODO/FIXME comments once report work lands.

Execution order recommendation:
1) Historical dataset replacement + tests
2) Report/charts/sankey/tables implementation
3) Golden + integration test suite
4) Final validation hardening pass

Notes:
- Keep JSON-path-specific validation error quality.
- Preserve documented simplifications unless intentionally upgraded with tests.
- Run `python3 -m pytest -q` before each commit.
